# NeuRolls

NeuRolls is a mobile application that offers users to keep track of the movies, tv series, anime, books, manga, comics, and games that they wish to watch in their leisure time. These entertainments can range from old ones to very recent releases, and the user can add friends or families that they can watch with. With the details that the user will provide, NeuRolls can keep track of all the movies, books, games, etc. that the user wishes to watch or have watched, manage wish lists/watchlists, remind the people that the user wants to watch with through the contact list, and also allows the user to share his or her experiences in social media after finishing a movie/book/game.
